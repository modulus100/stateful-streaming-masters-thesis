\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction-results}
This section is describing experiments results with different conditions
for Kafka Streams and Apache Flink.
For each experiment, the following parameters are used:

\begin{description}
    \item[Experiment execution time] 18 minutes
    \item[Messages per second] 200000
    \item[Message size] 1KB
    \item[Number of Kafka topic partitions] 50
    \item[Worker killing period] 3 minutes
    \item[Number of states] 20000
    \item[Selectivity] 50\%
\end{description}


These experiments that were running for this case study:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Kafka Streams with having 8 worker replicas killed every 3 minutes
    \item Kafka Streams with having 2 worker replicas killed every 3 minutes
    \item Apache Flink with having 2 worker replicas killed every 3 minutes
    \item Apache Flink with having 8 worker replicas killed every 3 minutes
\end{itemize}
