The research in this case study aims to compare the
efficacy of Apache Flink and Kafka Streams for stateful stream processing for specific use case.
The purpose of the experiments is to provide an impartial
and fair comparison of the two frameworks, with a focus
on important performance metrics and resource consumption.
The main platform for performance evaluation is AWS cloud infrastructure.
