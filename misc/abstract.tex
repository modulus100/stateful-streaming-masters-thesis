Software engineering is a diverse field that focuses on addressing various business domain problems.
These domain-specific issues and their corresponding use cases necessitate in-depth analysis to determine
the most suitable technologies for achieving optimal problem-solving outcomes.
One rapidly growing area in software engineering is big data.
Although big data is sometimes regarded as a marketing term, it encompasses complex data processing frameworks and datasets.

As the volume of produced data has dramatically increased over the years,
modern technical solutions capable of processing massive amounts of data are required.
The open-source community offers a decent frameworks and tools, making it challenging to choose the best option.
This research focuses on comparing the most suitable frameworks for specific use cases,
particularly those that designed for stateful real-time stream processing.

Stream processing use cases are relatively rare compared to typical problems that can often
be solved with traditional batch processing or simple program which doesn't require MapReduce
model or DAG.
However, stateful stream processing assumes that real-time processing relies on previous states,
and unbounded data flow which may indicate abnormal system behavior, such as fraud alerts in financial transactions
within a specific time frame.
Quick response can facilitate necessary actions and save time.
Therefore, it is crucial to provide a technical analysis of the most suitable frameworks,
assess their advantages and disadvantages, and examine the complexities involved in their
application for stateful stream processing based on given use case.
This master's thesis offers a technical overview,
benchmarks, and comparisons for appropriate use cases.
The use case examines considers that each incoming event triggers state re-computation and
evaluates how efficiently Kafka Streams and Apache Flink manage state under heavy loads,
represented by a stream of Kafka messages.
The ideal framework should address existing problems while offering excellent scalability,
fault tolerance, and cost efficiency.
This master's thesis aims to provide an answer and a technical overview based on the given requirements.
