    abstract = {Google’s MapReduce programming model serves for processing large data sets in a massively parallel manner. We deliver the first rigorous description of the model including its advancement as Google’s domain-specific language Sawzall. To this end, we reverse-engineer the seminal papers on MapReduce and Sawzall, and we capture our findings as an executable specification. We also identify and resolve some obscurities in the informal presentation given in the seminal papers. We use typed functional programming (specifically Haskell) as a tool for design recovery and executable specification. Our development comprises three components: (i) the basic program skeleton that underlies MapReduce computations; (ii) the opportunities for parallelism in executing MapReduce computations; (iii) the fundamental characteristics of Sawzall’s aggregators as an advancement of the MapReduce approach. Our development does not formalize the more implementational aspects of an actual, distributed execution of MapReduce computations.}

    title = {Distributed Snapshots: Determining Global States of a Distributed System},
    year = {1985},
    month = {February},
    abstract = {The distributed snapshot algorithm described here came about when I visited Chandy, who was then at the University of Texas in Austin. He posed the problem to me over dinner, but we had both had too much wine to think about it right then. The next morning, in the shower, I came up with the solution. When I arrived at Chandy's office, he was waiting for me with the same solution. I consider the algorithm to be a straightforward application of the basic ideas from [27].

In 2012, a reader noticed that the paper's reference list includes a paper by Chandy and me titled On Partially-Ordered Event Models of Distributed Computations, claiming it had been submitted for publication. Several times I have made the mistake of referencing a paper of mine "to appear" that never appeared. But I can't imagine that I would have claimed that a nonexistent paper had been submitted for publication. However, neither Chandy nor I have any memory of that paper or the reference. My guess is that we inserted the reference in a preliminary version when we expected to write and submit the other paper, and then we forgot to remove it.},
